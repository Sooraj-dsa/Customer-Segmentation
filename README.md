### Introduction

Let's start from the beginning. We'll explore our dataset, clean it up, and make it sparkle. ✨

### Data Cleaning

No one likes messy data! We'll tidy things up to ensure we have reliable information to work with.

### Feature Engineering

Get ready for some fun! We'll create new features, scale our data, and prepare it for the magic of clustering.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Ever heard of PCA? It's like using magic glasses to see your data in a whole new way! We'll reduce the complexity of our dataset while preserving its essence.

### Clustering

Now, the grand finale! We'll group our customers based on their buying habits. 🎩✨

### Evaluation

Time to dig deep. We'll analyze our clusters to see who's who and what makes each group unique.

### Conclusion

We'll wrap up by profiling our customer clusters. 🌟 Who are the stars and who needs some extra love? It's all here!
